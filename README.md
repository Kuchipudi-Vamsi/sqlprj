We design a database schema for an e-commerce platform that:

Organizes data efficiently
Represents real-world entities like customers, products, and orders
Defines how those entities are related to one another

We understand the Domain (E-commerce) and We identify what kind of information an e-commerce system needs to store:

Customers and their details
Products and their categories
Orders and items in the orders
Payments made by customers

We identify Entities (Tables) and Their Attributes (Columns) Typical entities:

Customers, Products, Categories, Orders, OrderItems, Payments
Design Relationships
Establish foreign keys to link related data:
A customer can have many orders
An order can include multiple products
Each product belongs to one category

We Use SQL to create each table, define columns, primary keys, and foreign keys to enforce relationships. and draw an ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship Diagram)
A visual representation that shows:

Tables (entities)
Columns (attributes)
Lines (relationships with cardinality like one-to-many)

âœ… Outcome
In this task, You will have:

A normalized SQL schema with all necessary tables and constraints
A clear ER diagram showing how all data is connected

This task builds foundational database design skills used in real-world application development.
